# Face Recognition System

## Project Description
This face recognition system uses Python to perform real-time face detection and recognition through a webcam feed. It integrates advanced libraries such as OpenCV for handling image processing and `face_recognition` for detecting and recognizing faces. The system also utilizes pyttsx3 and SpeechRecognition for an interactive voice feedback feature, making it versatile for applications ranging from security to personal identification and beyond.

## Features
- **Real-Time Face Detection and Recognition:** Uses the webcam feed for immediate detection and recognition.
- **Voice Feedback:** Provides an audible confirmation when a person is recognized.
- **Webcam Integration:** Designed to work seamlessly with standard webcam setups.
- **Performance:** Optimized for speed and reliability using Python.
